# RUBYONRAILSTUTOR.COM LESSONS
"Before May 2012, I had never programmed much beyond my watch or something.  I attended the 2nd class at Dev Bootcamp.  I have since tutored numerous people and built a large community of beginners learning Ruby on Rails.  I continually see that many people skip the fundamentals, which leads them to follow complex tutorials, never get where they want to go and ultimately give up.  I have developed and tested this curruciulum with the express intent of teaching the most basic elements of MVC inclined web applications and software using Ruby on Rails.  If you let me guide your learning process, I guarantee that you will learn more efficiently and faster than anything else on the internet"  - @railstutor | john [at] rubyonrailstutor.com
