#RUBYONRAILSTUTOR.COM - LESSON 1
##STRINGS, HASHES, ARRAYS

### CLASS STYLE
I demonstrate, explain and then each person in turn replicates.  If you don't know how something works, pay attention and learn, if you do know how it works, challenge yourself by making sure everyeone else in the group can do it, help others extend their learning edges.   Extra points, good for free beer, find John's knowledge edges on these topics.  



### LEARNING GOALS
  - irb vs script.rb
  - variable instantiation

  ```ruby
  name = "john"
  ```

  - string manipulation  

  ```ruby
  name = "john".reverse
  p name
  ```

  - string interpolation

  ```ruby
  first = "john"
  last = "davison"
  full_name = first + last
  # why doesn't the '+' try to 'add' the names ? 
  p full_name
  ```

  - how to define a function and what functions do

  ```ruby
  def example_method
    name = "john"
    p "my name is #{name}"
  end
  ```
  - return values, explicit and implicit

  ```ruby
  def example_method
    name = "sarah"
    p name
    "fred"
  end
  ```

  - array manipulation, array traversal

  ```ruby

  ```

  - hash manipulation, hash traversal, symbols, k/v pairs
  - use of ruby enumeratives/enumerables
  - understand the difference between 'indexed' arrays and unsorted hashes
  - how to pass arguments to a function
  - if else control flow
  - how to use .map, .each, .select, .gsub, .reverse
  - what is the difference between 1 and "1"
  - what does nil mean ?
  - ruby and parethesis, or lack there of
  - double spacing and indentation, do it. no questions asked.
