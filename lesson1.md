#RUBYONRAILSTUTOR.COM - LESSON 1
##STRINGS, HASHES, ARRAYS

### CLASS STYLE
I demonstrate, explain and then each person in turn replicates.  If you don't know how something works, pay attention and learn, if you do know how it works, challenge yourself by making sure everyeone else in the group can do it, help others extend their learning edges.   Extra points, good for free beer, find John's knowledge edges on these topics.  



### LEARNING GOALS
  - irb vs script.rb
  - variable instantiation

```ruby
name = "john"
```

  - string manipulation  

```ruby
name = "john".reverse
p name
```

  - string interpolation

  ```ruby
  first = "john"
  last = "davison"
  full_name = first + last
  # why doesn't the '+' try to 'add' the names ? 
  p full_name
  ```

  - array manipulation, array traversal
  - hash manipulation, hash traversal, symbols, k/v pairs
  - use of ruby enumeratives/enumerables
  - understand the difference between 'indexed' arrays and unsorted hashes
  - how to define a function and what functions do
  - how to pass arguments to a function
